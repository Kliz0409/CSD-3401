		<h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
		<p class="introduction">Hello! My name is Kaden Lizama. I was born and raised in the Island of <span id="Guam">_______</span> until my Freshman year of Highschool. After my Freshman year, my 			family and I would be stationed in Colorado Springs, Colorado for the next three years.</p>

				onclick="document.getElementById('Guam').innerHTML=firstVariableValue">Guam</button> <br />
		<p>While in <span id="Colorado"> ________</span>, this is where I would see the most personal growth for myself. I spent a lot of my childhood shut in playing video games(I still dabble in games 				though) and never developed many activities outside of that. Colorado was a breath of fresh air and a change of scenery from the small island that I was from which helped me come out of my shell and 			develop some hobbies outside of just games.</p>

				onclick="document.getElementById('Colorado').innerHTML=secondVariableValue">Colorado</button> <br />
		
		<p>In 2020, my time in Colorado ended and my family and I were stationed once again, this time to Honolulu <span id="Hawaii">________</span>. Being back on an island was definitely something I had 		to get used too, I hated the feeling of being land locked again. But with time, I met some really good people out here and started to finally settle back into the island lifestyle.</p>
			<button type="button"
				onclick="document.getElementById('Hawaii').innerHTML=thirdVariableValue">Hawaii</button> <br />

		<p>Fast forward to <span id="2024">__________</span> and I've settled in and found my place here in the islands again. I spend most of my free time either at work or at home trying to rush in 				assignments. Other than that my hobbies consist of either the gym catching up on video games that I have not had the time to play.
